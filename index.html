          The enigma of the universe is fascinating yet intimidating. Scientific
          research has attempted to uncover the mysteries of the universe, but
          there is a long way for humanity to grasp even a fraction of the
          observable universe. Astronomy is the branch of science that engages
          with the observable universe's components and physics: stars, planets,
          galaxies, etc. On the flip side, Cosmology is the physical study of
          the universe from its earliest form during the Big Bang till
          contemporary times. It is an amalgamation of Astrophysics and Physics
          manifested to examine the nature of the universe. Cosmology's exciting
          aspect is that the discipline may even circumscribe religious and
          philosophical contemplation of the cosmos and nature. Anaximander is
          both known as the 'father of Astronomy' and the 'father of Cosmology.'

          Astronomers want to understand the Universe, from the Big Bang to the
          present day, and what the future will hold. In Leiden they focus on
          two key questions: ‘How did stars and planets originate’ and ‘How were
          galaxies and black holes formed in the young Universe?’ A new
          generation of telescopes – just operational or still under
          construction - will help them find the answers. Maybe we will even
          detect signs of life on planets outside our solar system.
